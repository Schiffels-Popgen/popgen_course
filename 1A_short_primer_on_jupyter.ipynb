    "This course lives in Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter is a platform to perform computational work through your webbrowser. You can read more about it [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content-quickstart.html). The most important component of Jupyter is the notebook interface. Notebooks are documents which mix text with code, which makes it an ideal tool for teaching. Every notebook is connected to a specific _kernel_, which determines the programming language behind the code blocks, and the interpreter which runs that code. In this code, we'll be using Bash, python and R kernels. When you create a new notebook, you can choose the kernel you want. This very notebook is connected to a Bash kernel."

    "First, there is a file browser, which you can see as the starting view when you for example run this repository on a local computer and execute `jupyter notebook` inside this repository. The file browser allows you to view, rename and move files around. New files and folders can be created with the \"New\" button on the top right."

    "Third, there is a terminal, which you can start by clicking on \"New\" on the top right of the file browser, and then selecting a terminal window. Terminals allow you to work with the command line to run commands in Bash or other languages. We'll make little use of that here and there, but it might be useful if you have some experience with command lines."

    "1. Create a new folder in the file browser and name it \"test\"\n",
    "2. Go into the folder by clicking on it and create a new text file in it, named \"hello.txt\".\n",
